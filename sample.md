Current Medical Appointment Scheduling (Without AI)
Scenario: Sarah, a Type 1 diabetic patient, needs to schedule an appointment with Dr. Martinez, her endocrinologist.
What happens today:

Sarah calls clinic (waits on hold 15 minutes)
Receptionist asks questions:

"What's the reason for visit?"
"Do you have a preference for time?"
Sarah mentions she needs morning appointments because her blood sugar is most stable then


Receptionist checks schedule manually:

Sees afternoon slots available this week
Morning slots not until 3 weeks out
Doesn't know if Sarah's medical condition justifies earlier morning slot


Receptionist offers afternoon slot

Sarah explains her diabetes management requires morning
Receptionist: "Let me check with the doctor and call you back"


Receptionist messages Dr. Martinez (via EMR or Slack)

Dr. Martinez is with patients, sees message hours later
Checks Sarah's chart, confirms morning is medically necessary
Messages back: "Yes, give her the 9am slot on Tuesday, move Johnson to afternoon"


Receptionist calls Sarah back (next day)

Sarah misses call, plays phone tag
Finally connects, confirms appointment


Insurance verification happens separately:

Someone manually checks if visit is covered
Sometimes this happens after appointment (surprise bills)



Problems:

Takes 2-3 days for simple scheduling
Multiple phone calls and messages
Doctor interrupted for administrative decision
Medical context (why morning matters) lost in communication
Insurance verification delayed or forgotten
Patient frustrated by delays
Staff time wasted on coordination

This is what we're improving with collaboration.
